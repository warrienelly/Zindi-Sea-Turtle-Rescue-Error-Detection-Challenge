# Zindi-Sea-Turtle-Rescue-Error-Detection-Challenge
The objective of this competition is to create a machine learning model to help Kenyan non-profit organization Local Ocean Conservation identify potential errors and anomalies in their sea turtle rescue database from their By-Catch Release Programme. The data used to train the model will be ‘dirty’ and ‘cleaned’ data containing all of the unique sea turtle rescues that took place from 1998 until 2011. To date, Local Ocean Conservation has released over 10,000 sea turtles.

I did not use any maachine learning model in this competition.
Basic analysis.ipynb is where i carried out analysis to bring out wrong data manually, while my submission file was made using submission_creation.ipynb
